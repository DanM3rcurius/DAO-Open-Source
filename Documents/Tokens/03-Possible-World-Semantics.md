## 03-Possible-World-Semantics Governance Token

### Can Possible World Semantics be a viable alternative to game theory equilibria in Governance Token design ?

**Thesis:** Define a Governance Model using Possible World Semantics in terms of what is necessary (what must happen) and possible (what can happen). Infer how different Governance Models may interact with each other via their possible world accessibility relations.

**Thesis:** If a Possible World Semantics can be represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph, then a Governance Model defined in terms of a Possible World Semantics can be tokenised.

**Thesis:** If Governance Model using Possible World Semantics can be tokenised this would produce a set of possible Governance Models with a variety of accessibility relations. This means that some Governance Models would be incompatible with others because they lacked a common necessity. This is a feature (not a bug) because it represents the variety of human Governance.

### Simple Overview

For all propositions p (&#8704; p) and all worlds w1 ( &#8704; w1) the valuation of the necessity that p is true in world w1 is true ((V(&#9633; p, w1)=t) &#8801;
