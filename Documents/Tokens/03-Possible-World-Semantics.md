## 03-Possible-World-Semantics Governance Token

### Can Possible World Semantics be a viable alternative to game theory equilibria in Governance Token design ?

**Thesis:** Define a Governance Model using Possible World Semantics in terms of what is necessary (what must happen) and possible (what can happen). Infer how different Governance Models may interact with each other via their possible world accessibility relations.

**Thesis:** If a Possible World Semantics can be represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph, then a Governance Model defined in terms of a Possible World Semantics can be tokenised.

**Thesis:** If Governance Model using Possible World Semantics can be tokenised this would produce a set of possible Governance Models with a variety of accessibility relations. This means that some Governance Models would be incompatible with others because they lacked a common necessity. This is a feature (not a bug) because it represents the variety of human Governance.

### Game Theory and Modal Logic

Nash equilibrium games can be modelled using modal logic. But I am thinking of sets of possible worlds which may or may not be accessible to each other. Rather than a worlds that are always balanced between all possibilities in equilibria.

### Simple Overview

> R (w1, w2)

If two possible worlds are related then a propostion that is necessary in one world (w1) is true in the other world (w2).

> p (&#8704; p) ( &#8704; w1) ((V(&#9633; p, w1)=t) &#8801; (&#8704; w2) (R(w1,w2)>(V(p,w2)=t))

For all propositions p (&#8704; p) and all worlds w1 ( &#8704; w1) 

the valuation of the necessity that p is true in world w1 is true is defined as ((V(&#9633; p, w1)=t) &#8801;

if and only if for all worlds w2 (&#8704; w2)

such that w2 is accessible to w1, then the valuation of p in w2 is true (R(w1,w2)>(V(p,w2)=t))

Abstract  : We introduce a sound and complete graph calculus for multi-modal logics.  This formalism internalizes the (Kripke) semantics of modal logics and provides uniform tools for expressing and manipulating modal formulas. We present the graph calculus for logic K and show how to extend it to handle some modalities,like the global and difference modalities, in a natural manner. We also indicate how it can be easily extended to other normal modal logics, such as T, S4, S5,
