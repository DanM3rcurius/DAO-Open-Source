## Token-Work-Contract.

Between **NFT-DAO** and **QA-DAO**

This contract is an not a legal document but an experimental test case of an **Inter-DAO agreement**.

**QA-DAO** commits (no warranty) to contributions to the open-source projects of **NFT-DAO**, in return for the Fee of **1 NFT-DAO Token** (an **Audit Token**) that records **QA-DAO's** contribution with free text (an arbitrary data record) and an **NFT-DAO** graphic image. 

Relevant Daedalus Wallet data and a [Cardano Registry entry](https://forum.cardano.org/t/introducing-the-cardano-token-registry-for-on-chain-identifiers/57594) will be provided. At an estimated cost of **5 Dollars** (or the cost of minting said Token).

To be reviewed when DAO LCC status is granted to either party.
