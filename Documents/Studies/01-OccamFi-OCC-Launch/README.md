## 01-OccamFi-OCC-Launch

The purpose of this study is to:

1 – Build an open-source Token Launch Risk Model.

2 – Document and communicate with the Catalyst Community the launch of a token that aims to bridge the Ethereum and Cardano blockchains.

3 – Provide a detailed timeline of a Token launch to inform future strategy, development, and testing in other Catalyst proposals (particularly Token launches).

4 –  Assess with the Catalyst Community how different financing models such as outside Venture Capital, in contrast to Project Catalyst funding, may impact the reception of a token launch.
